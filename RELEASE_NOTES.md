<!-- UPDATE_LOG -->

- Added Agent `platform` sessions that keep SSH running through the CloudSSH panel without requiring tmux, while retaining tmux mode for recovery across CloudSSH restarts.
- Added browser attachment to the exact Agent platform terminal, including shared output, single-writer lease takeover, resize, and Agent runtime labels in the connections list.
- Added Agent SFTP list, read, upload, download, mkdir, rename, and delete operations with project scopes, local-path-only transfers, audit records, and bounded concurrency.
- Added remote tmux pinning that survives SSH disconnects and CloudSSH restarts, plus platform keepalive pinning that keeps browser-detached SSH sessions running without tmux.
- Added an explicit choice to install tmux, use platform keepalive, or cancel when tmux is unavailable; CloudSSH never installs it silently.
- Added controlled tmux installation through apt-get, dnf, yum, apk, or zypper as root or with passwordless sudo, without requesting sudo passwords or returning package-manager output.
- Deferred pinned-session environment variables, initial directory changes, and startup commands until the selected pinning mode is ready.
- Added simple telemetrics to PostHog (user count, total hosts across users, and version metrics).
- Reworked Electron desktop app to run standalone-first with a now optional sync to a remote Termix server.
- Added support for starting connections locally or from the remote server on desktop app.
- Added support for custom key shortcuts.
- Added support for more MFA types (SSH-only).
- Added multiplayer/shared sessions for terminals and remote desktop (share via link or user).
- Added support for logging into SSH hosts that require multi-factor authentication (like Duo or JumpCloud push/TOTP prompts).
- Added the option to convert a Quick Connect session into a saved host after connecting.
- Added an export option for sharing host entries without credentials, so a host list can be shared without leaking passwords or keys.
- Unified the folder picker across hosts, credentials, and snippets so they all use the same searchable, create-in-place selector.
- Allowed pasting into the key recording field from the clipboard.
- Allowed sharing hosts that use authentication type "none".
- Allowed setting authentication type "none" on RDP hosts.
- Added the option to show two or more sidebar panels open at the same time.
- Added global custom themes that can be applied across all hosts instead of per host.
- Added a button to quickly create a Credentials entry from a host's existing authentication details.
- Added persistent split screen, so your layout and assigned tabs are restored after closing and reopening the app.
- Added tag matching to host search, so searching now matches tags as well as hostnames.
- Brought back the ability to collapse snippets.
- Added the ability to assign login credentials to an entire folder of hosts instead of one at a time.
- Added the ability to share terminal, VNC, and RDP sessions with other users, including read-only and read-write modes.
- Added the ability to share entire folders of hosts with other users instead of sharing hosts one by one.
- Added the ability to make folders of hosts available to specific users instead of everyone recreating them.
- Reworked SSH credentials to support both a password and an SSH key on the same credential, with an option to auto fill the password when prompted.
- Added a custom group claim option for OIDC login, useful for identity providers like Zitadel that don't use a plain "groups" claim.

<!-- BUG_FIXES -->

- Fixed every saved password SSH connection failing in the web terminal because the legacy database value `"false"` for forced keyboard-interactive authentication was treated as enabled and prevented the password from reaching ssh2.
- Fixed web connections rewriting managed project credentials from stale legacy host snapshots; project credentials are now read-only during connection and synchronized only by explicit host or credential mutations.
- Fixed older hosts failing every SSH connection with `source.portKnockSequence?.map is not a function` when port-knock data was stored as JSON text or malformed legacy data.
- Fixed legacy Agent create retries conflicting after terminal resize, while preserving conflicts when a new request explicitly changes runtime mode.
- Fixed Agent sessions getting stuck in `CLOSING` across CloudSSH restarts and fixed final terminal output being lost at the SSH close boundary.
- Fixed aborted Agent uploads holding concurrency slots until the error response path completed.
- Fixed streamed Agent uploads by verifying the received body digest and rechecking device approval before any SFTP operation.
- Fixed missing tmux being misdetected as installed when an SSH server writes a login notice to stdout before returning a non-zero command status; pinned windows now show the explicit install or platform-keepalive choice instead of failing after an attach attempt.
- Fixed the Add Channel dialog failing with "config is required" when adding Webhook or ntfy alert channels.
- Fixed font size and UI scaling being too small even at the largest setting on high resolution displays.
- Fixed the Docker integration not working on hosts using authentication type "none".
- Fixed the latest Russian translation updates from Crowdin not being included in the app.
- Fixed missing Nerd Font symbol support in the Android app.
- Fixed credential changes on RDP hosts not saving properly.
- Fixed credential folders not showing up in the folder dropdown when editing a credential.
- Fixed RDP hosts not using their stored credential and falling back to a direct connection.
- Fixed Cmd + scroll on Mac resizing the terminal instead of scrolling.
- Fixed text repeating itself in the terminal when typing with a wireless keyboard on Android.
- Fixed RDP connections failing when going through a jump host.
- Fixed SSH connections failing when going through a jump host in some setups.
- Fixed OIDC login failing with a database error when the identity provider didn't return a client ID.
- Fixed SSH client-to-server tunnels failing with an authentication error.
- Fixed Host Metrics disk usage only showing the root filesystem and ignoring other mounted disks.
- Fixed Android navigation buttons covering the terminal's top bar keys.
- Fixed Proxmox discovery importing DHCP LXC containers with an IP of 0.0.0.0 instead of their real address.
- Fixed VNC connections to macOS Screen Sharing hanging after the handshake instead of connecting.
- Fixed File Manager delete still failing on Windows hosts running PowerShell 5.1.
- Fixed the terminal dropping characters while typing on iOS.
- Fixed SSH lines like "[username@host]" being wrongly highlighted as a log level and breaking output formatting.
- Fixed RDP touch mode on Android not registering taps as clicks.
- Fixed VNC connections still failing due to a guacd protocol version mismatch.
- Guacamole tab showing "connecting" instead of rendering the desktop.
- Fixed tmux not using Tailscale when starting connections.
- Fixed an invalid websocket frame from causing code 10006 crash triggering restart loop.
- Remove chacha20-poly1305 without native ssh2 binding.
- Corrected SSRF blocklist from false-positive on all IPv4.
- Fixed terminal background image incorrectly displaying.
